# F & Q

### What's this?
This is a quick & simple search tool to help me check for my poor pooch's allergy level for different kinds of food. The data comes from the allergy testings result pdf file provided by 5Strands Allergy testing. The original file is not very convenient since I can't dig into a 5-page pdf file whenever I'm shopping. They have also provided me with a search tool to search for food allergy level but I need to log in and click through a bunch of stuff to get to the search so imo it's not very useful for my use case as well.

The accuracy of the data is not neceddarily guaranteed but it's better than nothing

### What does different allergy level mean for Gourdy
- Sever: He will throw up on the carpet in the midnight, sometimes on my bed. He might be licking his poor feet and butt for weeks nonstop. It's VERY important that we AVOID these kinds of food as much as possible
- Moderate: He might lick his paw or throw up. Just try to avoid but if not, just a tiny little bit is okay imo
- Mild: Okay to eat. May cause allergy reactions but Gourdy has to eat SOMETHING
- Insignificant: Okay to eat. This means Gourdy's not allergic to it at all OR somehow they just didn't catch it. Just try bits by bits. 

### Poor Gourdy! Seems like he's a delicate dog that requires a lot of work
Yes he is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Why not post a pic of Gourdy so that everybody knows what he looks like?
